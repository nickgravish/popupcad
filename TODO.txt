Accomplished:

Script that takes in hinge file and programmatically changes two geometry parameters in it then tiles a 25mmx25mm laminate with the first cuts and release cuts. It tiles the upper and lower portions making 2x12 parts in this case

todo:
fix the .gitignore to ignore more stuff
script to tile a generic part
incorporate this functionality into class methods of popupcad to make the scripts easier
add to documentation
